Machine Learning Final Project
------

Due date: 2018-12-07   
Purpose: Build an end-to-end machine learning model.   
Signup: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iOp3_00-PA_wJ0V8DQUhZyvOGF5mt7KlH3YRWikcGuo/edit?usp=sharing)   

### Learning Outcomes:

- Formulate a meaningful and answerable Data Science research question
- Munge real data
- Create and tune a machine learning model
- Communicate your process and findings to a technical audience
- Write working and well-organized code

You should follow the Data Science Workflow:

1. Ask the right question
2. Acquire the relevant data
3. Process the data
4. Model the data with machine learning
5. Deliver: Create presentation and Jupyter Notebook

These steps are iterative (do a little preprocessing, do a little modeling, redo the preprocessing, …).

This project will become a part of your public Data Science portfolio, thus all data must be public data.  

Make your own groups of 3-5 students. They can be across sections.

----
1. Ask the right question
----

This is your project so it is up to your team to develop the right question. 

----
2. Acquire the relevant data
----

It is best if your team picks a single, unique dataset. The instructor will approve the data to make sure it is appropriate and within scope.

Acquiring data should not take away from the other aspects of the project (i.e., no collecting or web scraping the data). 

----
3. Process the data
----

- What specific munging issues do you have to address (e.g., encoding, missing data, or data to exclude)?
- What descriptive/summary statistics are useful for understanding your data?
- What figures provide insight into your data?

----
3. Model
----

You must fit at least 2 different types of models and compare results. For example, your team could pick logistic regression and random forest. Or your team could pick k-means clustering and spectral clustering.

For each step, I want both an empirical and a logical justification for the choices you made. That is: show us that the choice you picked is empirically superior to the alternative (better F1 score, etc.) and explain why you think that is.  

----
5. Deliver
-----

You'll communicating your findings to a technical audience. You'll give a group presentation during the final exam period on 2018-12-07 and provide a link to GitHub with Jupyter Notebooks. The presentation will be 8 minutes with 2 minutes of questions and (hopefully) answers. The presentation and organization of your repo and code style will be scored.

Hints
----

- Make it run, make it right, make it fast. (in that order)
- Go end-to-end as quickly possible. From raw data -> simple model -> evaluation. Then explore options for each stage.
- How do I get a "A"? Do something groundbreaking (seriously). Either ground-breaking for the field or for the class.
