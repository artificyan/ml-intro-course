Student Assignment Submission Instructions
------

1. Rename notebook with your __login id appended to beginning__: `pipelines_grid_search_lab.ipynb` -> `bspiering_pipelines_grid_search_lab.ipynb`
1. Write code until unit tests pass (or you give up)
1. Submit with url link before due date (11/18 10pm) via https://www.dropbox.com/request/aOJ4IvBhZBeBGtdiIHr6 (Dropbox states `Lab-DT` that is the correct location)

Here are __invalid__ renaming examples :

- Brian_Spiering_pipelines_grid_search_lab.ipynb
- Brian_Spiering.ipynb
- bspiering.ipynb

If the file was not renamed in the right format, it would be regarded as no submission and graded as zero.

Do not add extra cells. Adding any additional cells will result in a zero grade.

You might have the phenomena of "it works on my computer" but still lost points. Even though their code passed all the tests on their computer, their code was not correct. 

There is a common logical fallacy with testing code: A failing test means there is guaranteed to be a problem. A passing test does not guarantee there is no problem.

I do my best to create a test suit, but tests are no guarantee of complete correctness. Remember - it is impossible to fully test a program http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Kaner_impossibility.pdf

The test are there to assist you and me, not replace thinking for you or me.
